// Salaried class should extend the Employee class. That means
// its constructor should take a name of type String and an id of type Int,
// and pass them to the Employee constructor.
//
// It also should have:
//   - an annual "salary" field of type Double
//
// It should override the pay() method to return the salary divided by 26.0.
//
// It should override the toString method to return a string with the
// name, id, and salary of the employee.
